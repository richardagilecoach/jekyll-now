## TLDR

I am an Agile Coach in the UK Civil Service. I coach, train and support senior leadership, teams and individuals across the globe to transform in the pursuit of value using Scrum, Kanban, LeSS, Lean, Post-its and good coffee, on my journey to Certified Team Coach with the Scrum Alliance. I also keep bees and live in the glorious South West near the beach :-)

### More about me

After setting off in Geography teaching after university then finding Project Management over 12 years ago, I then started to use and develop a range of agile techniques in different innovative boutique digital agencies across the UK. I helped them to launch film programmes with the Coop, smooth hair-free legs with Veet Reckit Benckiser and kept dogs pain-free around the world in 17 languages on 5 different platforms with a global pharmaceutical company. 

Moving into the public sector some four years ago, I work in a multi-disciplinary Agile delivery team tailoring techniques to deliver software and hardware projects for a technical organisation in the Civil Service. It has a range of national agencies, global partners and different timezones, working in a complex arena.

As part of the Agile function in the organisation, I was chosen to trial a formal Agile coaching pathway, accruing certification like a junior swimmer, on a journey from CSM to Certified Team Coach, via Lean Kanban, LeSS and SAFe, now providing agile coaching to thousands of colleagues across the sector on my journey to Certified Team Coach with the Scrum Alliance. I also help run a range of internal events, workshops, training courses and also setup an internal two day Agile Conference for those in our sector to share good practice and inspire Agile development. 

When I am not doing that, I am also a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and a 4th Generation Beekeeper. I live in the glorious South West near the beach and one day, one day...I will learn how to surf :-)
